# Documentation Maintenance Instructions

Keep `README.md` and `FUNCTIONALITY.md` synchronized with source changes.

Update `README.md` when a change affects user-facing behavior, prerequisites, configuration, CLI flags, output/logging, architecture, module responsibilities, tracked software, build commands, or release packaging.

Update `FUNCTIONALITY.md` when a change affects `src/` behavior, public/exported types, functions, constants, data flow, algorithms, configuration sources, target software definitions, log table structures, build scripts, release profile settings, or release packaging.

Required `README.md` structure:

- Project title and overview
- Prerequisites
- Building
- Configuration, including all environment variables
- Usage, including all CLI modes and flags
- Output, including stdout behavior, log file path pattern, and report tables
- Architecture and high-level data flow
- Modules
- Tracked Software
- Developer Credits for Imthatguyhere (ITGH | Tyler)

Required `FUNCTIONALITY.md` structure:

- Data Flow
- Configuration
- Build and release packaging when non-default build behavior exists
- One H2 section for each source module.
  - For each module: purpose, types, constants when applicable, public/exported functions, key internal functions when they explain behavior, and key algorithms
- All public/exported types, functions, and constants should be documented in the module section where they are defined. If a public/exported item is not documented in its defining module section, it should be documented in a separate "Public API" section at the end of the file with a note explaining why it is not documented in the module section.

When editing Rust source, include documentation updates in the same change. If no documentation update is needed, note why in the final response or change notes.
